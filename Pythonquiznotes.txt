'\n', '\t', '\\"(single quote character), '\"'(double quote character), '\\' backslash xharacter
All the strings listed above are single characters, even though they appear as two characters between the quotes. The backslash is used as an escape character: it signifies that the next character is not to have its "usual" meaning
Think of comparing the ord value of each string as determining which word/letter would appear first in the alphabet. "Dog" is less than "Doghouse" because the value after g for both strings is different, the ord value for letters at the start of the alphabet are less than the value for letters near the end of the alphabet. Uppercase is also less than lower case.
Comparing the length between 2 strings does not matter, individually index through every character in the strings and compare them with each other. It is only if up to a point where so far both strings have the same characters so far in them but one of the strings ends while the other continues
